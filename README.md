# odin-recipes
Hi everyone, in this mini-proyect I will be making simple only-HTML
recipes page. I expect to cover the basics of HTML.

The proyect consists of 2 type of pages:
*Main page(Index.html)
*Recipies(directory)

In the first one we can see the "Odin Recipies" title with an unordered list of recipies.
The recipies pages consist of a title, which is the name of the plate, an image of the plate,
a brief description, the ingredients and the steps to follow.
