# odin-recipes
Hi everyone, in this mini-proyect I will be making simple only-HTML
recipes page. I expect to cover the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**

The proyect consists of 2 type of pages:
1.  **Main page**(index.html)
2.  **Recipes**(mila-napolitana.html and ravioles.html)

In the first one we can see the "Odin Recipies" title with an unordered list of recipies.
The recipies pages consist of a title, which is the name of the plate, an image of the plate,
a brief description, the ingredients and the steps to follow.

## Update:
CSS has been added in the last git-push of this directory. It seems that the idea is to improve this website during the TOP curriculum.

*I will probably be giving the website some updates as I go through the course.*
